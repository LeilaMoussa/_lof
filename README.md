# \*lof
\<something\>lof: my undergrad research/capstone programming sandbox
----------------
## Repository
- lof: replication of basic LOF
- anns: replications of ANNS techniques
- ilof: archived replication of ILOF
- rtlofs: multi-module project containing algorithms i'm aiming for
- producer.py: kafka producer

## Immediate Todos

- [ ] debug ILOF (might require a refactor)
- [ ] write results to sink file
- [ ] write script to test sink file against expected results and generate ROC curve
- [ ] call ilof from rlof
- [ ] finish rlof (note: EvictingQueue, TarsosLSH)
- [ ] generate ROC curve for RLOF
