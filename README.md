# \*lof
\<something\>lof: my undergrad research/capstone programming sandbox
----------------
## Todos

- [ ] finish and test insert phase of ilof
- [ ] implement and test update phase of ilof
- [ ] implement memory ceiling for ilof
- [ ] replace in-mem collections with state stores where possible
- [ ] prototype lsh
- [ ] perhaps, prototype nsw
... and then I can move on to all things summarization: dilof? milof? c_lof? but first, rlof!
