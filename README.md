# lof
My undergrad research programming sandbox
----------------
## Todos
- [ ] write my final profiles to a file
- [ ] write test that checks my final profiles to ELKI final profiles
- [ ] most importantly: review my code and find out why (1) my LOF scores don't match what is expected and (2) as a corollary, why i'm only coming up with 8 of the 10 expected outliers
