# \*lof
My undergrad research programming sandbox
----------------
## Todos
For lof.py:
- [x] write my final profiles to a file
- [x] write test that checks my final profiles to ELKI final profiles
- [x] most importantly: review my code and find out why (1) my LOF scores don't match what is expected and (2) as a corollary, why i'm only coming up with 8 of the 10 expected outliers
- [x] get all tests to run and maybe write some more
- [ ] clean code
- [ ] maybe optimize

Other stuff to code:
- Kafka producer + consumer that implements ILOF
- kd tree kNN search
- ball tree kNN search
- lsh kNN search
- (maybe) hnsw
